## Confusions and questions

- Q: When does the painkiller injection system work? Does it work all the day? If yes, does the $baseline \times time$ exceed the total amount per day. If no, do we need an interface for physician to set the injection period?

- Q: Obviously, the baseline is set by the physician. Then what about the bolus?

- Q: Does 'total amount per day' mean 'per 24 hours'?

- Q: About the physician interface?
