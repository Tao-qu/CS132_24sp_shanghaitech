# Traceability for Elevator

Team 5 Project 1

## Introduction

This Traceability Report documents the relationship between the requirements (R), their implementations (S), and validation (T) processes for the elevator system. The report aims to ensure that all functional requirements are addressed and traceable to their respective implementations.
